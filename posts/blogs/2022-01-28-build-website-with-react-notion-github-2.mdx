After playing around with some templates (including non-official ones), I felt like it’s too complicated to understand other’s projects as a Gatsby and React novice. Thus, I finally made up my mind to build a website from scratch, and the goal is to use Notion as the content database, Gatsby/React as the website template, and hosted on GitHub with a customized domain.
