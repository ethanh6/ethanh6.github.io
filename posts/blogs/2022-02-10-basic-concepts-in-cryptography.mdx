# 5 main terms:

1. Plaintext 明文
    1. The original form of the message, that we want to encrypt, represented as `m` or `p`
    2. The finite set of all possible plaintexts is called “message space”.  represented as `M` or `P`
2. Ciphertext 密文
    1. the encrypted text, represented as `c`
    2. The finite set of all possible ciphertext is called “ciphertext space”.  represented as `C`
3. Key 金鑰
    1. the encrypted text, represented as `k`
    2. The finite set of all possible ciphertext is called “key space.”  represented as `K` 
4. Encryption Algorithm 加密演算法
    1. the function that turns plaintext into ciphertext with a key `k`, represented as `E`
    2. $c=E_k(m)$
5. Decryption Algorithm 解密演算法
    1. the function that turns ciphertext  into plaintext with a key `k`, represented as `D`
    2. $m=D_k(c)$

For a meaningful encryption scene, it’s required that  $m = D_k(E_k(m))$ , which means that under the same encryption scene, the decryption function will always decrypt the original message.
